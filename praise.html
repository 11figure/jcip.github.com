      <blockquote>
        <p>
          I was fortunate indeed to have worked with a fantastic team on the
          design and implementation of the concurrency features added to the Java platform
          in Java 5.0 and Java 6. Now this same team provides the best explanation yet of
          these new features, and of concurrency in general. Concurrency is no longer a
          subject for advanced users only. Every Java developer should read this
          book.

        <p>
          For the past 30 years, computer performance has been driven by Moore's
          Law; from now on, it will be driven by Amdahl's Law. Writing code that
          effectively exploits multiple processors can be very challenging. <i><b>Java
          Concurrency in Practice</b></i> provides you with the concepts and techniques
          needed to write safe and scalable Java programs for today's&mdash;and
          tomorrow's&mdash;systems.

          This is the book you need if you're writing&mdash;or designing, or
          debugging, or maintaining, or contemplating&mdash;multithreaded Java programs. If
          you've ever had to synchronize a method and you weren't sure why, you owe it to
          yourself and your users to read this book, cover to cover.

          Brian addresses the fundamental issues and complexities of concurrency
          with uncommon clarity. This book is a must-read for anyone who uses threads and
          cares about performance.

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          This book covers a very deep and subtle topic in a very clear and
          concise way, making it the perfect Java Concurrency reference manual. Each page
          is filled with the problems (and solutions!) that programmers struggle with
          every day. Effectively exploiting concurrency is becoming more and more
          important now that Moore's Law is delivering more cores but not faster cores,
          and this book will show you how to do it.

        <p>
          I have a strong interest in concurrency, and have probably written more
          thread deadlocks and made more synchronization mistakes than most programmers.
          Brian's book is the most readable on the topic of threading and concurrency in
          Java, and deals with this difficult subject with a wonderful hands-on approach.
          This is a book I am recommending to all my readers of <i>The Java Specialists'
          Newsletter</i>, because it is interesting, useful, and relevant to the problems
          facing Java developers today.

        <p>
          I've focused a career on simplifying simple problems, but this book
          ambitiously and effectively works to simplify a complex but critical subject:
          concurrency. <i><b>Java Concurrency in Practice</b></i> is revolutionary in its
          approach, smooth and easy in style, and timely in its delivery--it's destined to
          be a very important book.

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <b><i>Java Concurrency in Practice</i></b> is an invaluable compilation
          of threading know-how for Java developers. I found reading this book
          intellectually exciting, in part because it is an excellent introduction to
          Java's concurrency API, but mostly because it captures in a thorough and
          accessible way expert knowledge on threading not easily found elsewhere.
