<h1 class="PageTitle">Praise for <i>Java Concurrency in Practice</i></h1>

<p>&quot;I was fortunate indeed to have worked with a fantastic team on the
design and implementation of the concurrency features added to the Java platform
in Java 5.0 and Java 6. Now this same team provides the best explanation yet of
these new features, and of concurrency in general. Concurrency is no longer a
subject for advanced users only. Every Java developer should read this
book.&quot;<br>
--Martin Buchholz<br>
JDK Concurrency Czar, Sun Microsystems</p>
<p>&quot;For the past 30 years, computer performance has been driven by Moore's
Law; from now on, it will be driven by Amdahl's Law. Writing code that
effectively exploits multiple processors can be very challenging. <i><b>Java
Concurrency in Practice</b></i> provides you with the concepts and techniques
needed to write safe and scalable Java programs for today's--and
tomorrow's--systems.&quot;<br>
--Doron Rajwan<br>
Research Scientist, Intel Corp</p>
<p>&quot;This is the book you need if you're writing--or designing, or
debugging, or maintaining, or contemplating--multithreaded Java programs. If
you've ever had to synchronize a method and you weren't sure why, you owe it to
yourself and your users to read this book, cover to cover.&quot;<br>
--Ted Neward<br>
Author of <i>Effective Enterprise Java</i></p>
<p>&quot;Brian addresses the fundamental issues and complexities of concurrency
with uncommon clarity. This book is a must-read for anyone who uses threads and
cares about performance.&quot;<br>
--Kirk Pepperdine<br>
CTO, JavaPerformanceTuning.com</p>
<p>&quot;This book covers a very deep and subtle topic in a very clear and
concise way, making it the perfect Java Concurrency reference manual. Each page
is filled with the problems (and solutions!) that programmers struggle with
every day. Effectively exploiting concurrency is becoming more and more
important now that Moore's Law is delivering more cores but not faster cores,
and this book will show you how to do it.&quot;<br>
--Dr. Cliff Click<br>
Senior Software Engineer, Azul Systems</p>
<p>&quot;I have a strong interest in concurrency, and have probably written more
thread deadlocks and made more synchronization mistakes than most programmers.
Brian's book is the most readable on the topic of threading and concurrency in
Java, and deals with this difficult subject with a wonderful hands-on approach.
This is a book I am recommending to all my readers of <i>The Java Specialists'
Newsletter</i>, because it is interesting, useful, and relevant to the problems
facing Java developers today.&quot;<br>
--Dr. Heinz Kabutz<br>
<i>The Java Specialists' Newsletter</i></p>
<p>&quot;I've focused a career on simplifying simple problems, but this book
ambitiously and effectively works to simplify a complex but critical subject:
concurrency. <i><b>Java Concurrency in Practice</b></i> is revolutionary in its
approach, smooth and easy in style, and timely in its delivery--it's destined to
be a very important book.&quot;<br>
--Bruce Tate<br>
Author of <i>Beyond Java</i></p>
<p>&quot;<b><i>Java Concurrency in Practice</i></b> is an invaluable compilation
of threading know-how for Java developers. I found reading this book
intellectually exciting, in part because it is an excellent introduction to
Java's concurrency API, but mostly because it captures in a thorough and
accessible way expert knowledge on threading not easily found elsewhere.&quot;<br>
